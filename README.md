# Design 

   ### Color Scheme  
   I took my main inspiration on the colour scheme from the Tie Dye background image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sharonmccutcheon">Sharaon McCutcheon</a> I used for the sites header and footer </a>. I've listed the hex numbers of the colours I used below.
        
 * #fc66ca
 * #fcb9fc
 * #8ab0ef
 * #cfb0f3
     
  ### Typography 
  Roboto is the font chosen for use across the website site , with Sans Serif as the back up font in case 
  there are any issues importing into the site correctly from Google Fonts. Kavoon was also used in the creation of the clients logo using Photoshop. Roboto and Kavoon both help convey the clients brand connotations and ethos, so both meet the clients requirements in a font.

# Features

Each page shares the same header and navigation bar. The header contains the clients logo and a sub heading with a tag line. The tag line succinctly reinforces the brands ethics and mission statement. Just below the header is a navigation bar that runs the length of the page. The navigation bar features navigational links to Home, About , Shop and FAQ pages. The colours used for each of these navigational links is repeated on each page, to ensure coherency throughout the website. Each page has a footer with social media icons linking to the clients social media accounts. The footer echoes those colours and the background image used on the header, ensuring coherent design approach. 

<b><i>Home</i></b>

The Home page features a Jumbotron Bootleg Component as it's main feature. This catches the visitors eye, and quickly explains to the visitor how the website works. Key information is highlighted using a striking pink. The colour creates contrast against the sites white background, and the shade of pink can be found in the background image used throughout the site on both the header and footer.  

A call to action button allows a visitor to navigate to the shop in one click to begin browsing the various garments. To compliment the rest of the sites colour palette I've used a blue found in the background image used in the sites header and footer. The blue is only used on buttons that will ultimately aid the visitor in bidding on garments. Its my hope that returning visitors associate this blue with the task of bidding on items, thus making navigation through the site second nature.

<b><i>About</i></b>

The About page consists of three small paragraphs that quickly address three unique selling points that the clients brand has over its competitors. To make the text on the page more digestible I have used three images that reflect the brands ethos, and also the content of the text. 

To make the page easier to read on remote devices I've changed the running order of how the paragraphs and images appear on larger screen sizes. The images now break up the paragraphs, so when you scroll down on a mobile device the text doesn't become overbearing, and is far easier to absorb. 

<b><i>FAQ</i></b>

The FAQ is laid out in two columns containing an accordion component and a hero image. The accordion saves space, and also allows the visitor to concentrate on specific questions and answers that concern them. 

The layout stays consistent until we get to remote screen sizes. In medium screen sizes a single image leaves a great deal of empty space, so a second hero image is used to improve the layout of the column. To improve remote screen size user experience, all hero images disappear and only the accordion remain. 

<b><i>Shop</i></b>

The Shop is relatively simple at this stage, but will allow the client to add additional garments as and when they are available. The page consists of three cards running from left to right of the screen. Below each image is key information on the garment, and then a call to action button should the visitor want to place a bid on the garment. The call to action button is the same blue as can be found on call to action button on the Home page.  

# Existing Features

* Header Logo - Exists on every page and allows the user to easily recognise the clients brand. Clicking the logo   returns the user to the home page as they would expect.
* Header Navigation Bar - Exists on every page and allows the user to easily navigate across the website.
* Footer Social Icons - Exists on every page and allows all users to access the clients social media platforms. 
* Call to Action Buttons - Exists on the Home and Shop page. They allow the user to quickly bid on a garment. 
* "So, How Does This Work?" - Is the first thing a visitor will see once they visit the home page. It allows potential clients to understand the steps involved in bidding on a garment. 
* About Us - Allows visitors to understand the clients journey, ethos and what they represent. 
* Modal for Images - Allows visitors to the shop to view garments easily without having the leave the website. The visitor can click on the garments image, a pop out of that image will appear.  
* Modal for Bidding - Allows the visitors to easily express interest in a garment. Visitor clicks the button and a     modal appears, giving them the opportunity to register there email address. This allows the client to contact      the potential customer at a later date with information on future auctions.     

# Features Left to Implement

* <i>GDPR Checkbox</i> - Allows the visitor to approve the client to use the visitors email address to inform them of future auctions. Also ensures the client complies with EU data protection law. 
* <i>Garment pages</i> - Once the visitor clicks on a garment it will take them to a web page dedicated to that garment. It will provide more images of the garment, more detailed information on the garment and an opportunity to bid on that garment. 
* <i>Count Down</i> - On the home page will be a large count down notifying visitors of when the next auction will begin.    It will be synced to the websites back end when the auction goes live and when the auctions stops.   
* <i>Remote View Nav Bar</i> - In remote screen sizes current nav bar could become overbearing. Testing results gave conflicting feedback, so this feature may or may not be required. 
* <i>Additional Footer Menu</i> - As the client and visitor requirements grow over time an additional footer menu will be required, linking the visitor to pages covering shipping & return and privacy policy & terms. 
* <i>Input Text Footer</i> - This will allow the visitor to input there email address and an opportunity to submit there details to be notified on any exciting news in the future.
* <i>Site Back End</i> - The site is going to need a back end capable of quite extensive features. Not only will the back end need to keep track of bids on each specific auction, it will have to store these bids chronologically and also from highest to lowest bid. Once the auction ends the backend will have to generate an email the highest bidder notifying them that they have won. That email will also include a link back to the site to complete payment. 
* <i>Facility to Process Secure Online Payment</i> - As mentioned above the recipient of the winning bid email will be directed back to the site. The link will have to send them to a secure location that the customer can pay and fulfil there winning bid.
