* ## Design 

    * ### Color Scheme  
        * I took my main insperation on the color schceme from the Tie Dye background image I used for my header and footer by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sharonmccutcheon">Sharaon McCutcheon</a>. I've listed the hex numbers of the colors I used below.
        
         * #fc66ca
         * #fcb9fc
         * #8ab0ef
         * #cfb0f3
     
    * ### Typography 
        * Roboto is the font chosen for use across the website site , with Sans Serif as the back up font in case 
        there are any issues importing into the site correctly. Kavoon was also used in the creation of the clients logo. Roboto and Kavoon both sharethe same connotations as the brand image of the
        organisation, so it meets the clients requirements.

# Features

Each page shares the same header and navigation bar. The header contains the clients logo and a sub heading with a tag line. The tag line succinctly reinforces the brands ethics and mission statement meeting one of the clients requirements. Just below the header is a navigation bar that runs the length of the page. The navigation bar features navigational links to Home, About Us, Shop and FAQ pages. The colors used for each of these navigational links is repeated on each page, to ensure coheriency throughout the website. This meeets the first time vistors requirement "I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find key content" Each page has a footer with social media icons linking to the clients social media accounts. The footer echoes the color and background image of the header, again echoing the coheriatnt design approach. 

<i>Home</i>

The Home page features a Jumbotron Bootleg Component as is main feature. This catches the vistors eye, and quickly explains to the vistor how the website works. Key information is highlighted a complimentry pink found in the Tie Dye background above, which stands out on the white background. 

I've then used a simple call to action button that once clicked leads the vistor to the shop to begin bidding. I've used a blue to compliment the Tie Dye background image used in the header, and also to stand out from the backgrond. This page meets the returning vistor goal of being able to "navigate to the store quickly.", "place a bid on an item quickly" and first time vistors requirement "to easily understand the main purpose of the site".

<i>About Us</i>

The About Us page consists of three small paragraphs that quickly address three unique selling points that the clients brand has over its competitors. To break up the page I have also used three images that reflect the brands ethos, and also the content of the paragraphs. 

To make the page easier to read on remote devices I've changed the running order of how the paragraphs and images appear on larger screen sizes. The images now break up the paragraphs, so when you scroll down on a mobile device the text doesn't become overbearing, and is far easier to obsorb. 

<i>FAQ</i>

The FAQ is laid out in two coloumns containing an accordian component and a hero image. The accordian saves space, and also allows the vistor to concentrate on the questions and answers that concern them. 

The layout stays consistant until we get to remote screen sizes. In medium screen sizes a single image leaves a great deal of empty space, so a second hero image is used to improve the layout of the column. To improve remote screen size user exprience, all hero images dissapear and only the accordian remains. 

<i>Shop</i>

The Shop is relativley simple at this stage, but will allow the client to easily additional garmets as and when they are available. The page consits of three cards running from left to right of the screen. Below each image is key information on the garmet, and then a call to action button should the vistor was to place a bid on the garmet. 

# Existing Features

This allows the client to contact      the potential customer at a later date to inform them when the auction begins.     

# Features Left to Implement

* <i>Garmet pages</i> - Once the vistor clicks on a garmet it will take them to a web page dedicated to that garmet. It    will provide more images of the garmet, more detailed information on the garmet and an oppertunity to bid on      garmet. 
* <i>Count Down</i> - On the home page will be a large count down notfying vistors of when the next auciton will begin.    It will be synced to the websites back end when the auction goes live and when the auctions stops.   
* <i>Remote View Nav Bar</i> - In remote screen sizes current nav bar could become overbearing. Testing results gave       conflicitng feedback, so this feature may or may not be required. 
* <i>Additonal Footer Menu</i> - As the client and vistor requirements grow over time an additonal footer menu will be     required, linking the vistor to pages coveriing shipping & return and privacy policy & terms.

Notes on issues i got passed: 
* couldn't get Re-Tie Dye logo to fit properly when the page went from large to small. Got around this by setting the setting display to block, margin left and right to auto and then exprimented with the width percentage until I found an option that worked. 
* had unwanted white gaps in my navigation li elements, used the inspector tool and discoverd the bootstrap item "list-inline-item" sets a margin automatically. In my style.css I set that class to 0 margin. Also created my own class in the Ul called menucontainer and set the font size to 0. This sorted out the issue but now the font in my li was 0, so using an id called nav I targeted the li's within that id and set there font size so I could see my navigation headings. Saved images depiciting this. 
* used https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/ to figure out how to center a button "Click me to get Bidding!"
* margins for two bottstrap container classes weren't lining up, discovered container class had padding-right and padding-left settings. I had to over right these settings using insepctor tool in chrome. I then set padding right and padding left for all container classes to 0 in style.css.
* struggling to get the social icons to center. tried using combination of row justify-content-center with a single col-12 but it wouldn't center. Quick fix I used three col 4, copied the social icons into the 2nd col 4, then created a class called social-align to text align the icons. I left the 1st and 3rd col 4 blank and got the end effect. This isn't a perfect fix and I would like to find another solution. have images.
* wasn't happy with my navigation so used https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp as insperation for new navigation. taken screen shots. 
* header was looking good on desktop screens, but got overly large screen sizes below 767px, used media queries to display none the second col containing websites tagline. taken screen shots.
* The text in the paragraphs of on the About Us page were looking good but they lined up with the top of the images, I needed the text to align with the center of the cols. To do this I used bootstrap align-self-center. 
* Un order list on index wouldn't center, used d flex and justify content center to try and center it. But due to the differing lengths of the bullet points it still didn't look centered. So I changed the background of the col to create a box, which is centered and that seems to have improved the overall look of the un ordered list on large screens. 
* order of the hero images and paragraphs on the about me page looked good for mobile devices, but the order didn't work in larger screen sizes. I used bootstrap order to change the order between one hero and one paragraph in small breakpoints and above. This now makes the about me page layout work for both mobile and larger devices. 
* faq looked good on large screen sizes, but the hero image took up too much space on smaller screen sizes. It also left a lot of blank space on medium and small screen sizes. To get past this issue I used a second hero image and slotted it just underneath the orginal hero using a div. I then used bootstap d none, d sm block, d sm none, d md block, d md none and d lg none. I used d none, d md block and d lg none on image of the male model, so it would only show in medium screen sizes. This would solve the issue of too much blank space in medium screen sizes. It would also not show in small screen sizes, which wouldn't compound the issue of the hero taking up too much screen size. I think used d none, d sm none and d md block on the orginal female. This would prevent the hero from appearing in smaller screen sizes thus making the website more responsive. Now only the important FAQ information is present on mobile screen sizes.
